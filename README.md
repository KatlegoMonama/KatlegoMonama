# Grub n Chill - Business Analytics

## About Me

Hi, I'm Katlego Monama, a **self-taught Software Engineer** and **Project Manager** with a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. I specialize in data analysis, SQL queries, and implementing business optimization strategies for both **small and large businesses**. My goal is to help businesses like yours maximize their profits and streamline their operations through intelligent use of data and technology.

With experience in **product design**, **branding**, **motion graphics**, and **audio-visual design**, I enjoy mixing creative technologies to deliver unique business solutions. I am here to help you understand how business analytics can provide insights into your operations, identify opportunities for growth, and optimize profitability.

---

## Business Analytics

This project focuses on **data-driven business optimization** for small to large businesses. Specifically, I will demonstrate how **sales data** can be used to increase profitability in a fast-food restaurant context, such as **Grub n Chill**.

By using **SQL queries**, we analyze the cost structure of products, identify which products are the most profitable, and suggest actions to optimize profits. One example of this is the **fries** at a fast-food restaurant, which, due to its low cost and high margin, can drive significant profit.

---

## SQL Query Example

Below is an example SQL query used to analyze **sales data** and calculate the profit margin for various products sold at a restaurant.

```sql
-- Calculate the profit for each product and analyze what sells best
SELECT 
    product_name,
    SUM(quantity_sold) AS total_quantity_sold,
    AVG(cost_price) AS average_cost_price,
    AVG(selling_price) AS average_selling_price,
    (AVG(selling_price) - AVG(cost_price)) * SUM(quantity_sold) AS total_profit,
    (AVG(selling_price) - AVG(cost_price)) / AVG(cost_price) * 100 AS profit_margin_percentage
FROM 
    sales_data
GROUP BY 
    product_name
ORDER BY 
    total_profit DESC;
```

This SQL query groups products by name and calculates the **total profit** and **profit margin percentage** based on the **cost price** and **selling price**.

For detailed analysis on **business optimizations**, check out my [**Business Insights Blog**](https://your-blog-link.com).

## Profit Margin Analysis

Let’s break down the profit margins for some key items at **Grub n Chill**:

### 1. **Fries**

- **Cost Price per 100g**: R6.80
- **Selling Price per 100g**: R27.20
- **Profit Margin**: **300%**

### 2. **Burgers**

- **Cost Price per Burger**: R25.00
- **Selling Price per Burger**: R100.00
- **Profit Margin**: **300%**

| Product      | Cost Price (per 100g) | Selling Price (per 100g) | Profit Margin (%) |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Fries**    | R6.80                | R27.20                   | **300%**           |
| **Burgers**  | R25.00 (per burger)  | R100.00 (per burger)     | **300%**           |

---

## Key Insights

- **Fries**: Despite having a **300% profit margin**, they remain a high-margin product that significantly contributes to overall profits. With a **cost price of R6.80** and a **selling price of R27.20**, fries offer an affordable option for consumers while still providing a strong profit.
  
- **Burgers**: These items also have a **300% profit margin**, making them one of the most valuable products for both customers and the business alike. Focusing on high-margin products like these can greatly enhance profitability.

---

## How This Helps Businesses

Understanding your **sales data** and **profit margins** is essential for making informed business decisions. Businesses can make smarter choices on:

- **Pricing Strategies**: Adjust prices based on data to improve margins.
- **Product Mix**: Focus on high-margin products like fries and burgers while maintaining cost-effective offerings.
- **Cost Optimization**: Regularly monitor the cost price of products, including raw materials, labor, and overheads.

By applying this approach to your own business, you can **increase profits**, **reduce waste**, and **optimize operations**.
