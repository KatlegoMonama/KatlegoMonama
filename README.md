Here’s an example of an SQL query with sample data to analyze what products sell best at a restaurant like McDonald's, focusing on **fries**, and showing how analyzing data can improve profits for businesses:

### Sample Data: `sales_data`

| product_id | product_name | cost_price | selling_price | quantity_sold | date       |
|------------|--------------|------------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| 1          | Fries        | 2.50       | 25.00         | 200           | 2025-01-01 |
| 2          | Burger       | 5.00       | 50.00         | 150           | 2025-01-01 |
| 3          | McFlurry     | 3.00       | 30.00         | 100           | 2025-01-01 |
| 4          | Fries        | 2.50       | 25.00         | 300           | 2025-01-02 |
| 5          | Burger       | 5.00       | 50.00         | 200           | 2025-01-02 |
| 6          | McFlurry     | 3.00       | 30.00         | 150           | 2025-01-02 |
| 7          | Fries        | 2.50       | 25.00         | 250           | 2025-01-03 |
| 8          | Burger       | 5.00       | 50.00         | 100           | 2025-01-03 |
| 9          | McFlurry     | 3.00       | 30.00         | 120           | 2025-01-03 |

### SQL Query to Calculate Profit and Analyze Best-Selling Product (Fries):

```sql
-- Calculate the profit for each product and analyze what sells best
SELECT 
    product_name,
    SUM(quantity_sold) AS total_quantity_sold,
    AVG(cost_price) AS average_cost_price,
    AVG(selling_price) AS average_selling_price,
    (AVG(selling_price) - AVG(cost_price)) * SUM(quantity_sold) AS total_profit,
    (AVG(selling_price) - AVG(cost_price)) / AVG(cost_price) * 100 AS profit_margin_percentage
FROM 
    sales_data
GROUP BY 
    product_name
ORDER BY 
    total_profit DESC;
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
1. **`SUM(quantity_sold)`**: Calculates the total quantity sold for each product.
2. **`AVG(cost_price)`**: Calculates the average cost price of the product.
3. **`AVG(selling_price)`**: Calculates the average selling price of the product.
4. **`(AVG(selling_price) - AVG(cost_price)) * SUM(quantity_sold)`**: Calculates the total profit made on each product.
5. **`(AVG(selling_price) - AVG(cost_price)) / AVG(cost_price) * 100`**: Calculates the profit margin percentage for each product.

### Sample Result:

| product_name | total_quantity_sold | average_cost_price | average_selling_price | total_profit | profit_margin_percentage |
|--------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Fries        | 750                 | 2.50               | 25.00                 | 17,187.50    | 900%                     |
| Burger       | 450                 | 5.00               | 50.00                 | 20,250.00    | 900%                     |
| McFlurry     | 370                 | 3.00               | 30.00                 | 11,100.00    | 900%                     |

### Business Insights:

- **Fries**: From the SQL query, you can see that the **fries** are performing well, with a **900% profit margin**. The business is making **significant profits** from fries, given that the **cost price is only 2.50**, while the selling price is **25.00**.
  
  **Recommendation for Business**:  
  - **Increase production and promotion of fries** since it yields a high return. You may want to explore optimizing the **supply chain** to reduce costs and increase margins even further. Additionally, offering **combo meals** that include fries at a discount can help increase their sales volume.
  
- **Burgers and McFlurries**: Both **burgers** and **McFlurries** have the same **900% profit margin**, but the total sales from fries seem to be higher due to the larger quantity sold.

## How Analyzing Data Can Improve Business Profits

Analyzing sales data in this way gives **valuable insights** into which products provide the most profit and where adjustments can be made to improve the **profit margin**:

### Solutions to Improve Profits:

1. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Regularly analyze cost prices to identify areas for cost reduction, such as sourcing cheaper ingredients or streamlining production processes.

2. **Promotions and Combo Deals**:
   - Increase sales by bundling popular items, such as fries, with high-demand items like burgers. Offering combo deals can encourage customers to purchase more.

3. **Seasonal Offers**:
   - Analyze past data to identify trends in seasonal sales and create promotions during those times. For instance, if fries consistently sell well during holidays, special promotions or discounts can increase sales further.

4. **Menu Expansion**:
   - Based on sales analysis, adding complementary items or variations of the most profitable products (e.g., different flavors of fries or new dipping sauces) can attract more customers.

5. **Dynamic Pricing**:
   - Adjust the pricing of items based on demand. If fries have a high profit margin, consider running limited-time pricing campaigns or adjusting prices based on peak business hours.

6. **Marketing Strategies**:
   - Use the best-selling products in targeted marketing campaigns, leveraging both online and offline channels. Promoting high-margin items like fries can boost overall sales.

### Final Thoughts:

Using **business analytics** like this can lead to smarter decisions and higher profitability. By understanding the relationship between **cost**, **profit margins**, and **sales volume**, businesses can take actionable steps toward optimizing their offerings and maximizing their profits.

This is just one example of how data analytics can be applied to business strategy. Similar approaches can be made for any product or service offered by the business, ultimately leading to **higher revenues**, **better resource management**, and **increased customer satisfaction**.
